# Multi-endpoint assessment based on a joint model(MEJM)
## Introduction
It is a generalized framework for accurately determining the positivity thresholds of TMB and dividing patients into multiple subgroups based on a fusion analysis of immunotherapy efficacy. The model considered the discrete tumor response endpoint in addition to the continuous time-to-event (TTE) endpoint simultaneously to optimize the division from a comprehensive perspective.
## Usage:
Input: excel files with separate sheets record patients' observations (containing ORR and TTE endpoints, as well as other clinical indicators) and the corresponding TMB values.
Output: the optimal TMB thresholds
