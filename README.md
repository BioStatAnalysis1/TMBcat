# Multi-endpoint assessment based on a joint model

### Introduction
It is a generalized framework for accurately determining the positivity thresholds of TMB and dividing patients into multiple subgroups based on a fusion analysis of immunotherapy efficacy. The model considered the discrete tumor response endpoint in addition to the continuous time-to-event (TTE) endpoint simultaneously to optimize the division from a comprehensive perspective.
